## About
This was a Turing School project to continue practicing working in React.

### Project Goals & Requirements:
1. Get comfortable whipping together React components on your own with the additional complexity of implementing React Router (if you want to).
2. Write squeaky clean, well refactored code using ES6 syntax.
3. Make informed design decisions to create a user-friendly application.
4. Keep state based components to a minimum and leverage more functional components.
5. Use a modular architecture for your application file structure.
6. Think deeply about React Lifecycle Methods.
7. Use propTypes for every component receiving props.

### Important Notes
1. The API we are using is completely unsecured. This means we will be making all requests for this particular project directly from our browser. We will not be sending any advanced communication from a local server.
2. Although there are many resources out there for making API calls, you are asked to exclusively use the native fetch() API for this project. That being said, you are highly encouraged to experiment with axios and any other fun libraries you wish for comparison purposes.
3. The data does not need to persist. Feel free to implement Firebase or localStorage if you are so moved (it is also listed as an extension).
